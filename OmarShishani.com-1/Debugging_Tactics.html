<h2>Debugging Tip #1: Debugging a Particular Element</h2>
<p>
	When you're in the middle of building your webpage, and you run into an issue with your element, it may be difficult to discern what exactly the problem is, with so much going on in the code of your website. 
	<br><br>
	One way to narrow down the search, which I think is fantastic, is to create a 'test' html document, and paste the suspect element code into the new html document. This way you have a blank slate of html, with only the problem element on the page. 
	<br><br>
	If the problem still persists, you know that the criminal code is within the element. If the problem has vanished, you can successively add elements from your website page, until the problem reappears. This way, you can use step-by-step addition to deduce where the bug is coming from. 
	<br><br> 
	For example, I was having problems with the navbar for this website. I couldn't figure out why the buttons were not showing up when I was trying to add them to the page.

<h2>Float HTML order</h2>
<p>Float item will only float right of something if it precedes it in the html. Try changing html order to fix floats.</p>

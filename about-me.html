						About Me

						<p>
							I am a web developer who enjoys using the tools of the web to craft impressive interactive sites and applications that satisfy the users needs. I began my journey as a self-taught developer, and from then I have kept feeding myself with resources to hone my coding skills and keep a modern outlook on the web. I am constantly evolving, and I enjoy working on artistic, colorful projects that bring joy to people, as well as practical programming that increases efficiency and automates repetitive tasks.  
						</p>
						<p>
							I am an energetic positive person who loves technology and is very interested in computers and programming. To me, programming feels like a game, and I feel like a wizard being able to write code that can make the computer do amazing work for me. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I started learning to code in April 2019. I started with freeCodeCamp, taking their online lessons to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I then began a course on Udemy called The Web Developer Bootcamp. After that, I enrolled in a year-long university program for web development, where I have been continuing to build my foundation of programming skills. Aside from teaching coding, this university program included courses in UX and graphic design, where I enhanced my knowledge of design principles.

						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, I am honing my Javascript so that I can begin to learn React, and my goal is to work as a web developer for a startup company, a position where I would hope to be able to wear many hats, and be able to take part in a company’s early growth.

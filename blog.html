  I started working on the paver project, and as with the last project, I soon realized that I had underbid. Starting out doing these projects, I think it is important to add a 50% margin or error at least. This should be to cover unexpected events that occur under the course of a project, which will occur in any case, but especially when you are finishing someone else's project, and tacking on to their work. 

I should have figured that with a fraction of the physical strength of a man, that Hayley wouldn't be able to keep up. I guess I figured that she might be able to keep up anyway. After talking to Rick about how Mexican workers are very hard workers, I was more concerned about Hayleys ability to keep up. 

Bidding a project has alot of different parts. I started by analyzing each of the large parts of the project, and seeing how long each one was going to take.
